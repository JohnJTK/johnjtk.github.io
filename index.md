## 📖 Overview

crucible_train offers an easy way to manage machine learning (ML) training for the Crucible ecosystem. It helps you set up distributed training, optimize hyperparameters, and manage checkpoints. This application also supports model versioning, metrics collection, early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and mixed precision training. 

## 🛠 Features

- **Distributed Training**: Run training across multiple machines.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Find the best settings for your models automatically.
- **Checkpointing**: Save your model's progress and load it later if needed.
- **Model Versioning**: Keep track of different versions of your model.
- **Metrics Collection**: Monitor performance during training.
- **Early Stopping**: Stop training when your model stops improving.
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Adjust your learning rate during training.
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Train with larger batch sizes without needing more memory.
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Speed up your training while reducing memory usage.
- **Nx/Scholar Integration**: Harness additional tools for enhanced performance.
